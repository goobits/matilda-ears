# TODO: Voice Pipeline Development

## Core Infrastructure
- [ ] **Enhance Opus streaming performance** - Optimize real-time encoding/decoding for low-latency voice interactions
- [ ] **Improve conversation mode reliability** - Add partial transcription results and interruption handling for natural dialogue flow
- [ ] **Add wake word detection** - Implement hotword activation for hands-free operation (default: "Okay Matilda", customizable)

## Demo Implementation  
- [ ] **Create STT→TTS pipeline example** - Build conversational voice assistant demo showcasing end-to-end speech processing capabilities

## Fun Text Formatting Filters
- [ ] **Pirate Mode Filter** - Transform transcribed text to sound like a pirate ("Hello there" → "Ahoy there, matey!")
- [ ] **Cat Mode Filter** - Add cat-like expressions and behaviors ("I'm hungry" → "I'm hungry meow~ *paws at food bowl*")
- [ ] **Personality Filters** - Replace language with different character personalities:
  - [ ] **Valley Girl** - Like, totally transform text with valley girl speech patterns
  - [ ] **Shakespeare** - Render all speech in iambic pentameter and Elizabethan English
  - [ ] **Robot** - BEEP BOOP. CONVERTING. HUMAN. SPEECH. TO. ROBOT. PROTOCOL.
  - [ ] **Caveman** - Me want food. You give food now. Ugh.
  - [ ] **Victorian Gentleman** - Most distinguished and proper speech patterns, I dare say
  - [ ] **Surfer Dude** - Totally gnarly text transformation, bro! Catch those speech waves!

*Note: Opus foundation is solid, conversation mode has advanced VAD - focus on integration and user experience.*
